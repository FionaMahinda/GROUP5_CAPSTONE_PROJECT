**Amazon Sales Analysis with Power BI**

**Overview**

This project analyzes Amazon sales data using Power BI to provide insights into revenue generation, product performance, and customer purchasing trends. The analysis focuses on various key metrics that help understand sales dynamics across different categories and regions.

**Key Areas Analyzed**


1. Category Revenue Analysis: Examined how different product categories contribute to overall revenue, including total sales amounts and quantities sold.

2. Purchased Items Status: Analyzed the relationship between the quantities of items purchased and their status (e.g., shipped, pending).

3. Revenue by Category: Visualized total revenue against product categories using graphs for easy comparison.

4. Sales by Ship State: Provided insights into sales distribution across different states, showcasing quantities sold in each state.

5. Total Revenue Overview: Created a summary card displaying the total revenue received from sales.

6. Sales Trends Over Time: Analyzed total sales over a defined period to identify trends and fluctuations.

7. Sales Forecasting: Implemented forecasting models to predict future sales trends based on historical data.

8. Category Size Distribution: Mapped out the distribution of product sizes across different categories relative to their quantities sold and sales amounts.
